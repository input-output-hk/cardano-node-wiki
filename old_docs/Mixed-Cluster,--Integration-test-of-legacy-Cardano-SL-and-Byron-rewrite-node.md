`CI` shall be running for every commit a test on a mixed cluster of legacy Cardano SL nodes (https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/) and new nodes from Byron-rewrite (this repo: https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/).
The two worlds are interconnected using the Byron proxy (https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-byron-proxy/).
Either side can initiate transactions and mint blocks.
